          Medicinae Baccalaureus, Baccalaureus Chirurgiae), MBBS (also
          abbreviated as BM BS, MB ChB, MB BCh, or MB BChir) is a medical degree

          the United Kingdom's higher education tradition. Despite the
          historical distinction in nomenclature, these degrees are typically
          combined and conferred together. This degree is usually awarded as an
          undergraduate degree, but it can also be awarded at graduate-level
          medical institutions.[1] The typical duration for completion is five
          to six years.

          <dfn>Chartered accountants</dfn> were the first accountants to form a
          professional accounting body, initially established in Scotland in
          1854. The Edinburgh Society of Accountants (1854), the Glasgow
          Institute of Accountants and Actuaries (1854) and the Aberdeen Society
          of Accountants (1867) were each granted a royal charter almost from
          their inception.[1] The title is an internationally recognised
          professional designation; the certified public accountant designation
          is generally equivalent to it. Women were able to become chartered
          accountants only following the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919
          after which, in 1920, Mary Harris Smith was recognised by the
          Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and became the
          first woman chartered accountant in the world.

          A Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD; Neo-Latin: Pharmaciae Doctor) is a
          professional doctorate in pharmacy. In some countries, it is a
          doctoral degree to practice the profession of pharmacy or to become a
          clinical pharmacist. In many countries, people with their Doctor of
          Pharmacy are allowed to practice independently and can prescribe drugs
          directly to patients. A PharmD program has significant experiential
          and/or clinical education components in introductory and advanced
          levels for the safe and effective use of drugs. Experiential education
          prepares graduates to be practice-ready, as they already have spent a
          significant amount of time training in areas of direct patient care
          and research.
